## About Me

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto pursuing a major in Civil Engineering (Transportation focus) and a minor in Machine Intelligence. Currently, I am performing research at the Data Driven Decision Making Lab regarding the application of reinforcement learning to traffic perimeter control.

During my undergraduate studies, I've developed a love for computer science and data science in particular. Inside of school, I've developed the relevant knowledge and experience through coursework and competitions. I've taken numerous courses with high standings such as statistics, probability, data science and machine learning. Addtionally, I've trained and succesfully engaged in algorithmic programming competitions. In 2022 I scored 9th in the University of Toronto's Undergraduate Competitive Programming tryouts, and finished 15th/83 at the [East Central North America ICPC Regionals](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/East-Central-NA-2021/standings). Additionally, I've applied my reinforcement learning skills to [OpenAi's official Car Racing leaderboard](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard), scoring the highest test score and beating the environment at the 2nd lowest training cost.

Outside of school, I've had research internships at Data and Transportation labs focused on the application of state of the art machine learning techniques to practical problems. Currently I'm at the Data Driven Decision making lab researching the ability of reinforcement learning agents to regulate traffic inflow to large protected regions. This is a control problem, involving multiple cooperating agents. In the summer of 2021, I was at the University Transportation Research Institute, serving as a software engineer. I aided my supervisor in the calibration of Aimsun traffic models, developping new tools to process geospatial data. Some of this work is visible in my portfolio. 

## Research Interests
Currently I am researching the application of reinforcement learning agents to regulate traffic inflow to a large protected region. I would love to explore other practical applications of RL or the learning process such as imitation learning. I am also interested in spatial-temporal data and its prediction. In Transportation industry, this is used for traffic prediction, demand prediction, navigation and map services. Most importantly, I am open to exploring new areas of Data Science.
