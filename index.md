## About Me
I am a machine learning research intern at Huawei Technologies, and an engineering student at the University of Toronto.  

During my undergraduate studies, I've developed a love for computer science and data science. Through coursework, I obtained strong mathematical foundations by completing numerous classes with honours in statistics, probability, and machine learning. Through interships, I've gained exposure to SOTA technologies in the domains of autonomous driving, intelligent transportation systems, and robotics. I became familiarized with traditional traffic modelling techniques and geo-spatial data pipelines at the [University of Toronto Transportation Research Institute](https://uttri.utoronto.ca/). I learned cutting-edge traffic signal control methods using reinforcement learning at the [Data Driven Decision Making Lab](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca). Currently I work on autonomous driving at Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. First I investigated the topic of realistic traffic behavioural modelling in simulation with imitation and reinforcement learning. These simulators are used to test autonomous driving planning algorithms. Currently I am researching trajectory prediction algorithms. These are used during inference, to predict how the world will change while the vehicle is driving.

I've also enjoyed amazing extra-curricular experiences. In 2021 I rigorously trained in competitive programming. Later that year I qualified to join the University of Toronto's International Collegiate Programming Contest Team, with 2 teammates and myself finishing 15th/83 at the 2022 [East Central North America ICPC Regionals](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/East-Central-NA-2021/standings). I'm also a speaker at the University of Toronto Machine Intelligence Student Team, sharing my knoweledge in reinforcement learning to fellow students.


## Interests
I am interested in the modelling, prediction, and planning of spatial-temporal systems at micro or macro scale. These are used in industries such as Autonomous Driving, Intelligent Transportation Systems, and Robotics. As these systems proliferate, there will be strong demand for the necessary engineering and research skills to ensure accurate and safe end-products.
