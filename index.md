## About Me
I am currently a machine learning intern at Zoox (an autonomous robotaxi subsidary of Amazon). Previously I was a Master of Engineering in Computer Science student at Cornell University, and a machine learning research intern at Huawei Technologies Canada.  

Through internships at research labs I've gained exposure to SOTA technologies in Autonomous Robotics, Intelligent Transportation Systems, and Reinforcement Learning. At Huawei Noah's Ark Lab Autonomous Driving Division I investigated methods for realistic behavioral modelling for simulations using imitation and reinforcement learning. These simulations are used to test the safety of AV planning algorithms. Later I researched trajectory prediction algorithms, which are used to forecast how the scene will evolve while the vehicle is driving. At the [Data Driven Decision Making Lab](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca) and [University of Toronto Transportation Research](https://uttri.utoronto.ca/), I worked with cutting-edge techniques in traffic signal control and reinforcement learning. I have a strong mathematical foundation, having taken courses with high honors in topics such as probabilistic reasoning and statistics.


I've also enjoyed great extra-curricular experiences. In 2021 I rigorously trained in competitive programming. Later that year I qualified to join the University of Toronto's International Collegiate Programming Contest Team, with 2 teammates and myself finishing 15th/83 at the 2022 [East Central North America ICPC Regionals](https://icpc.global/). I've also pursued a long-standing endeavor in quantitative finance, actively reading and investing since I was a teenager.


## Interests
I have a broad set of interests and am open to new areas. These include the modelling, prediction, and planning of spatial-temporal systems which are used in robotics and transportation. I am also keen on quantitative finance, and the general application of mathematical models and machine learning.
