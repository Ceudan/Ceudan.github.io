## About Me

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto pursuing a major in Civil Engineering (Transportation focus) and a minor in Machine Intelligence. Currently, I am performing research at the Data Driven Decision Making Lab regarding the application of reinforcement learning to traffic perimter control.

During my undergraduate studies, I've developed a love for computer science and data science in particular. Inside of school, I've developed the relevant knowledge and experience through coursework and competitions. I've taken numerous courses with high standings such as statistics, probability, data science and machine learning. Addtionally, I've trained and succesfully engaged in algorithmic programming competitions. In 2022 I scored 9th in the University of Toronto's Undergraduate's Competitive Programming tryouts, and finished [15th/83 at the East Central North America ICPC regionals](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/East-Central-NA-2021/standings). Additionally, I've applied my reinforcement learning skills to OpenAi's official Car Racing [leaderboard](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard), scoring the highest test score and beating the environment at the 2nd lowest training cost.

Since 2018, I have been conducting research with [Prof. Oya Mercan](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/oya-mercan/) on seismic hazard mitigation for large Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) storage tanks. For my fourth-year capstone project, I am designing a ML-based predictive maintenance algorithm for HVAC systems under the supervision of [Prof. Markus Bussmann](https://www.mie.utoronto.ca/faculty_staff/bussmann/) and [Prof. Seungjae Lee](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/seungjae-lee/). I am also writing an undergraduate thesis on Automatic Drill-core Logging using Deep Learning under the supervision of [Prof. Sebastian Goodfellow](https://civmin.utoronto.ca/home/about-us/directory/professors/sebastian-goodfellow/).

Outside of school, I have over 20 months of industry internship experience in the structural engineering, software, and nuclear sector. In 2019, I worked at [Rocscience](https://www.rocscience.com/) as a geotechnical software developer to propose and implement computational methods for soil settlement under seismic loading. In 2020, I worked at [Arup](https://www.arup.com/) as a structural engineering intern to design stiffening and dampening devices that mitigated a crowd-induced floor vibration problem at Ohio State University. I also contributed to a web-based platform that controls iterative design processes through a centralized hub of engineering calculations. Since 2020, I have been designing structural systems for the next generation of Small Modular Reactors at [Terrestrial Energy](https://www.terrestrialenergy.com/) and conducting research on aircraft impact analysis. In addition, I held executive roles in several student design teams on campus and developed multiple in-house software that helped us place in the top 3 at national and international competitions.

My interests lie at the intersection of infrastructure and technology, and I hope to improve the efficiency and resilience of urban infrastructure systems using computational and data-driven techniques.
