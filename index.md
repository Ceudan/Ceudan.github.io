## About Me
I am a machine learning research intern at Huawei Technologies, and an engineering student at the University of Toronto.  

During my undergraduate studies, I've developed a love for computer science and data science. In particular I've decided to focus in the domains of Intelligent Transportation Systems, Autonomous Driving, and Robotics. I obtained the necessary mathematical foundations by completing numerous courses with honours in statistics, probability, machine learning and data science. I also gained exposure to SOTA technologies in my domain of interest through research. At the University of Toronto Transportation research Institute I became familiar traditional traffic modelling techniques and geo-spatial data pipelines. At the Data Driven Decision Making Lab I worked alongside researchers on intelligent traffic signal control with reinforcement learning. At Huawei technologies, I'm working on behavioural modelling techniques used for Autonomous Driving.

## Interests
I would love to explore other practical applications of RL or the learning processes. I'm also broadly interested in spatial-temporal data and its prediction. In Transportation industry, this is used for traffic prediction, demand prediction, navigation and map services. Most importantly, I am open to exploring new areas of Data Science.
