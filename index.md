## About Me

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto pursuing a major in Civil Engineering (Transportation focus) and a minor in Machine Intelligence. Currently, I am performing research at the Data Driven Decision Making Lab regarding the application of reinforcement learning to traffic perimeter control.

During my undergraduate studies, I've developed a love for computer science and data science in particular. Inside of school, I've developed the relevant knowledge and experience through coursework and competitions. I've taken numerous courses with high standings such as statistics, probability, data science and machine learning. Addtionally, I've trained and succesfully engaged in algorithmic programming competitions. In 2022 I scored 9th in the University of Toronto's Undergraduate's Competitive Programming tryouts, and finished 15th/83 at the [East Central North America ICPC Regionals](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/East-Central-NA-2021/standings). Additionally, I've applied my reinforcement learning skills to [OpenAi's official Car Racing leaderboard](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard), scoring the highest test score and beating the environment at the 2nd lowest training cost.

Outside of school, I've had research internships at Data and Transportation labs focused on the application of state of the art machine learning techniques to practical issues. Currently I'm at the Data Driven Decision making lab researching the ability of reinforcement learning agents to regulate traffic inflow to large protected regions. This is a special type of control problem, potentially involving many agents acting in unison towards a common goal. In the summer of 2021, I was at the University Transportation Research Institute, serving as a software engineer. I aided my supervisor in the calibratin of Aimsun traffic models, developping new tools to process geospatial data. Some of this work is visible in my portfolio. 

My interests lie at the intersection of infrastructure and technology, and I hope to improve the efficiency and resilience of urban infrastructure systems using computational and data-driven techniques.
