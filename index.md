## About Me
I am a reinforcement learning research intern at Huawei Technologies. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto pursuing a major in Civil Engineering (Transportation focus) and a minor in Machine Intelligence. 

During my undergraduate studies, I've developed a love for computer science and data science in particular. Inside of school, I've developed the relevant knowledge and experience through coursework and competitions. I've taken numerous courses with high standings such as statistics, probability, data science and machine learning. Addtionally, I've trained and succesfully engaged in algorithmic programming competitions. In 2022 I scored 9th in the University of Toronto's Undergraduate Competitive Programming tryouts, with 2 teammates and myself finishing 15th/83 at the [East Central North America ICPC Regionals](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/East-Central-NA-2021/standings). Additionally, I've applied my reinforcement learning skills to [OpenAI's official Car Racing leaderboard](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/Leaderboard), scoring the highest test score and beating the environment at the 2nd lowest training cost.

Outside of school, I have experience at both industrial research labs and academic groups. Currently, I am at Huawei technologies developing baselines for the 2023 [SMARTS competition](https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/6618). Later I will investigate developments in realistic traffic behaviour for autonomous driving simulation. Ego vehicle planning algorithms are trained in simulation for efficiency and experience control. Therefore its essential for the agents it interacts with to mimic the complex and chaotic maneuvers that humans perform in real life. Previously I researched under the supervision of [Prof. Scott Sanner](https://d3m.mie.utoronto.ca/members/ssanner/) regarding the application of reinforcement learning to traffic perimeter control. In 2021 I was a software engineer at the [University of Toronto Transportation Research Institute](https://uttri.utoronto.ca/) developing new tools to process geospatial data. Some of this work is visible in my portfolio. 

## Interests
I would love to explore other practical applications of RL or the learning processes. I'm also broadly interested in spatial-temporal data and its prediction. In Transportation industry, this is used for traffic prediction, demand prediction, navigation and map services. Most importantly, I am open to exploring new areas of Data Science.
